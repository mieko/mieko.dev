It's crazy how web communities work.

I tend to keep drafts for a long time before publishing. In fact, if you know your way around GitHub
Pages, even my drafts are public.  I'm staring at one now dated "2016-09-27" about iBeacons, a
lame Apple name for a lame BlueTooth LE technology I ranted about that came and went before I could
finish the post.

Anyway, my last post: [It's Almost 2020: It's Time for HTTPS by Default](https://mieko.dev/web/2019/10/24/https-by-default.html)
was originally written with the title `It's 2020: It's Time...`.  I titled it when I started
putting together ideas knowing it'd sit in `_drafts` for months, like every technical blog post I
make.

Well, it hit me and I got passionate about it for 30 minutes, typed up the rest of my thoughts, and
hit publish, without considering that I never made it past December, 2019.  So it published with a
title trying to trick readers into thinking it's 2020.

I did my normal share on `/r/programming` without this in mind, and it's fucking crazy how online
communities work.

I mean, I'm not saying it's a genius work there, but there's some substance.  I expected pros and
cons re: what effects would come about if browsers implemented HTTPS-by-default, etc.  Instead,
literally every comment was about the **OUTRIGHT DECEPTION** in the title, as if it were clickbait.

Yes, my intention was to, on October 24th, 2019, trick people into believing that it was the
year 2020.  The master plan.

Anyway, my bad, but there's your reddit technical community.
