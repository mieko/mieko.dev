These are the ranting grounds of the meter.md engineering group.  Posts here
tend to deal with technology, but that's not strictly necessary.

While the nerds here work at, on, or around meter.md, statements made here are
not the opinions of meter.md or official statements.  Think of it as a group
blog centered around an product.

We know you hate the [font](http://asdasd.rpg.fi/~svo/glasstty/), the blur
makes it literally unreadable, and you're tired of people being cute on the
internet.
